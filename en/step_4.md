## Make an animation

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
In this step you will create a copy of your image, edit it to be slightly different and display your new frames in order to make an animation.

<strong>Animation</strong> is created by swapping images (called frames) in front of your eyes very quickly. The rate at which the images are swapped is known as the <strong>frame rate</strong>, and it is measured in <strong>frames per second</strong> (how many pictures are shown to you each second). Normal TV and movies are usually shown at 24fps - that means each frame is only shown for 0.04 seconds! 
</p>

To create an animation, you need at least two frames or images which you can swap quickly. To do this, you will first create a copy of your image from the previous step, then edit it slightly.
