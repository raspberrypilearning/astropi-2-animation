## Introduction

In this project, you will create a series of images using the RGBLEDs on the SenseHAT array which can be cycled to create an animation.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">Animation</span> is a method of swapping still images very quickly in front of your eyes, that tricks your brain into seeing movement. A series of still images is shown quickly in sequence, and we see this as a moving picture - it's a lot like how films work, though they are a series of captured images of real live people rather than an artwork.

You will:
+ Choose colours and set them as variables in your code
+ Create images on the SenseHAT array
+ Cycle images to create an animation
