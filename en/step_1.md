## Introduction

In this project, you will create a series of images using the RGB LEDs on the Sense HAT LED matrix which can be cycled to create your own animation.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">Animation</span> is a method of tricking your brain into seeing movement by swapping still images very quickly in front of your eyes. A series of still images with minor changes in each one is shown quickly in sequence, and we see this as a moving picture - it's a lot like how movies work.

You will:
+ Choose colours and set them as variables in your code
+ Create images on the SenseHAT array
+ Cycle images to create an animation
