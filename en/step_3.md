## Encode an image

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
In this step, you will design your own image to display on the LED array, then code it!

</div>

To help you design an image that will fit on the LED array, we have created a simple tool in Scratch. You can show different colours by clicking on each square in the array that appears.

**Try:** Use the Pick-a-Pixel tool to design an image you would like to animate.

**Tip:** Don't make it too complex, or it will be hard to make out on the LED array (and difficult to animate).

Once you have designed your image, it needs to be encoded into a list of values python can use to light the LEDs on the SenseHAT.

You will need to copy the list of colours on your pixels into your python program.
